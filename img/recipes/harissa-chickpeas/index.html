<p>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the oil, and once it’s hot, add the onion and ¼ teaspoon salt . Mix well to coat, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally. If the pan is drying out too much, add 2 to 3 teaspoons of water to help the pan conduct heat and for the onions to brown evenly, about 7 to 9 minutes. Then once the onions are translucent and starting to get golden on some outer edges, add the balsamic vinegar and mix well. Continue to cook for another 3 to 4 minutes.</p>
<p>Then add in the garlic, smoked paprika, harissa, and oregano, and mix really well. Cook for a minute, so that the garlic gets cooked. Then add in the chard, remaining salt, the chickpeas, and the coconut cream and mix really well. Partially cover the pan, and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, then taste and adjust the flavor. If you want more sauce, you can add more nondairy milk. If you used full fat coconut milk, the sauce probably didn’t thicken as much, and if you want it to thicken even more, add in a tablespoon or two of non-dairy yogurt or sour cream. Add in a good squeeze of lemon juice and adjust salt and heat as needed.</p>
<p>Let everything simmer for another minute or two, if you want the sauce to thicken and glaze over the chickpeas. Switch off the heat and garnish with cilantro or parsley along with some black pepper and some more lemon juice. Serve with flatbread or rice or with some sourdough toast or garlic bread or whatever else that you like.</p>
